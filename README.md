# JavaScript Mini Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of **beginner to intermediate-level JavaScript projects** I built to strengthen my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Each project is placed in its own folder and can be run directly in the browser.

These projects cover **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **CSS styling**, and **basic logic building**, showcasing my ability to build interactive front-end features from scratch.
